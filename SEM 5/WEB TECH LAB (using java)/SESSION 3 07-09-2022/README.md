CONSTRUCTOR, METHOD OVERLOADING, ARRAY OF OBJECTS

1.	Write a program to compute perimeter of class Circle, Rectangle, Square using parameterized constructor.
2.	Write a program to design a class Volume and then find out the volume of a Cube, Cylinder and Sphere using method overloading. 
3.	Write a java class which consists of 5 integer data. Overload constructor (Default & parameterized) to initialize those integer data members. Write a method which sorts those integer data members using insertion sort.
4.	Suppose you have a money box with an initial amount of Rs.500 and you have to add some more amount to it. Create a class “AddAmount” with a data member named “amount” with an initial value of Rs.500. Now create two constructors of this class as follows:
a.	Without any parameter- no amount will be added to the money box
b.	Having a parameter which is the amount that will be added to money box
Create an object of the “AddAmount” class and display the final amount in money box
5.	Create a class to print an integer and a character with two methods having the same name but different sequence of the integer and the character parameters.
For example, if the parameters of the first method are of the form (int n, char c), then that of the second method will be of the form (char c, int n).
6.	Write a program to print the name, salary and date of joining of 10 employees in a company (Note: Use array of objects.)
